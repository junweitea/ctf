If the CTF just give us like a random string like "Ft}L_hrA$e3G1_w{ha$tn"
You can see this is probaby the flag but was randomised into different permutation 
Just go the cyberchef and use "Rail Fence Cipher Decode" and keep increasing the Key until you get the answer
And DA DAAAAA the flag is "FLAG{th1$_the_an$w3r}" after you increased the key level to 6
